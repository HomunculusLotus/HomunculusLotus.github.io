        I am a young and ambitious person seeking to take my first steps in the professional world and thus build my life; To this end, I am always looking to improve myself and my work. I learn as much as I can as often as I can. As a person, I'm more a behind-the-scenes type. My ideal role would
        be one that helps others demonstrate their work to the fullest possible extent to the widest possible audience, online.

      <p class="well"> I am proficient in HTML and CSS. I've not been coding particularly long but can put together a basic website. As for my other skills, I'm intermediate in Javascript though there are some weaknesses. My Bootstrap skills are only getting better, but they remain elementary for the time being. English is my mother tongue, est je suis conversationnelle en Francais.

<br>This is a tribute page to the revered Japanese ruler, Oda Nobunaga. It was my first project. The requirements were simply to make a clone of another site that looked similar to this one, but to make it about anyone or anything else than what was put forward as the example. I chose Nobunaga because I've had an interest in Japanese culture for many, many years now -- mostly due to the fiction the nation has produced. In it, Nobunaga is featured a fair amount but I've never sat down and actually looked into him with any sort of depth. He's always just been kind of a name -- one I recognize but don't really now. That's changed. Anyway, the full code can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/Kairoo/pen/YNZKay">here</a>, though it's nothing particularly impressive.
